                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Derrick Rose was raised, from the same grimy rough hood as myself, Englewood, Chicago. From high
                    school
                    basketball
                    stardom at Simeon to the NBA, Rose has been the epitome of what we like to call in Chicago,
                    "Gettin'It
                    Out The Mud". His
                    unparalled work ethic, grit, and passion to give it his all day-in and day-out continues to inspire
                    millions across the globe.
                    Personally, his synergy not only consistently drives me, but literally motivated me to write this
                    simple
                    webpage about him some of
                    his greatest accomplishments on and off the court.
